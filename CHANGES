================

Here you can see the full list of changes between each viktor release.

Version 0.2.3
-------------

- Added 'StridedVector.append' and 'StridedVector.concatenate' for
  joining multiple vectors into a single vector.
- Changed 'StridedVector.sort', '.argSort' and '.reorder' to be extension
  functions.
- Exposed 'StridedVector.partition'.

Version 0.2.2
-------------

Released on April 29th 2016

- Added unary operator overloads for 'StridedVector'.
- Implemented * and / operations for 'StridedVector'.
- Added extra operator overloads to 'Double', so it is now possible to
  write (1.0 + v / 2.0).
- Fixed 'StridedVector.toString' in case of 'NaN' and infinities.
- Changed 'StridedVector.toString' to be more like NumPy for larger vectors.

Version 0.2.1
-------------

Bugfix release, released on April 22nd 2016

- Changed 'StridedVector.quantile' to follow Commons Math implementation.

Version 0.2.0
-------------

Released on April 22nd 2016

- Changed all 'StridedVector' members are now public.
- Changed 'StridedVector.size' to be a property instead of a function.
- Removed 'StridedVector.wrap', please use 'DoubleArray.asStrided' instead.
- Implemented 'StridedVector.dot' for the case when the argument is
  also a 'StridedVector'.
- Added 'StridedVector.quantile' for (amortized) linear-time order
  statistic queries.
- Added 'StrudedVector.shuffle' for randomly permuting vector elements.

Version 0.1.4
-------------

Technical release, released on February 3rd 2016

- Migrated to Kotlin 1.0.0-rc.

Version 0.1.3
-------------

Technical release, released on February 1st 2016

- Renamed 'StridedVector.sorted' to '.argSort' to avoid confusion with
  the '.sorted' method on primitve arrays.

Version 0.1.2
-------------

Released on December 9th, 2015

- Overloaded '-' and '/' operations for 'StridedVector'.
- Removed redundant boxing and copying in 'StridedVector.sorted'.
- Fixed indexing in 'StridedMatrix3.equals'.
- Added two new operations 'StridedVector.mean' and 'StridedVector.sumSq',
  which are also applicable to matrices.

Version 0.1.1
-------------

Technical release, released on October 22th, 2015

- Updated to Kotlin 1.0.0-beta.
- Renamed '_' to '_I' because the latter isn't a valid identifier as
  of Kotlin M14. This is a temporary solution. I hope we'll find
  a more human-readable workaround eventually.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

Initial release, released on October 15th, 2015
